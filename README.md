### Simple RestAPI written in pure Java without a framework.

This is a maven project.<br>
Building and running the project starts `localhost:8000`.<br>
From there you can `GET` requests that come from a locally hosted `json` file.<br>
You can also `POST` data in json format.
Clean & Build the Project and give it a go!
