### Simple RestAPI written in pure Java without a framework.

This is a maven project.<br>
Libraries used are:<br>
* `Project Lombok` for writing less boilerplate code,
* `Jackson` for JSON support and
* `HTTPSERVER` for building embedded HTTP servers.<br>

Building and running the project starts a server at `localhost:8000`.<br>
From there you can `GET` requests that come from a locally hosted `json` file.<br>
You can also `POST` data in json format.<br>
Clean & Build the Project and give it a go!
